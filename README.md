**Q.1 What's the difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous?**

Synchronous and asynchronous are two different programming paradigms that describe how tasks or operations are executed in a program:

- **Synchronous**: In synchronous programming, tasks are executed one after another in a sequential manner. Each task must complete before the next task can begin. The program waits for each task to finish before moving on to the next one. It follows a blocking approach, where the execution is blocked until the current task is completed.

- **Asynchronous**: In asynchronous programming, tasks can be started, and the program can continue executing other tasks without waiting for the completion of the previous task. The execution does not block, and multiple tasks can be performed simultaneously. Asynchronous operations are typically non-blocking and allow the program to be more responsive and efficient.

To illustrate the difference, consider an example of reading data from a file:

- In synchronous programming, the program would read the file line by line, and it would wait for each line to be read before moving to the next one. The program execution would be paused during the file reading process.

- In asynchronous programming, the program would initiate the file reading process and continue executing other tasks without waiting for the file reading to complete. Once the file reading is finished, a callback function or a promise would handle the result.

Asynchronous programming is commonly used in scenarios where tasks involve waiting for external resources (e.g., network requests, file I/O, database queries) or tasks that can take a significant amount of time to complete. It allows the program to make efficient use of resources and provides a more responsive user experience.

**Q.2 What are Web APIs?**

Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of rules and protocols provided by web browsers to allow developers to interact with web browser functionality and access various services and features.

Web APIs provide a way for developers to extend the functionality of web browsers and build web applications that can interact with the browser environment. They expose a wide range of features and services, including:

- **DOM API**: The DOM (Document Object Model) API provides methods and properties for interacting with the structure and content of HTML and XML documents. It allows developers to manipulate, create, and modify the elements, attributes, and text within a web page.

- **XHR API**: The XHR (XMLHttpRequest) API provides methods for making HTTP requests to servers. It enables the retrieval and sending of data between a web browser and a server, allowing for asynchronous communication and data exchange.

- **Fetch API**: The Fetch API provides a modern, promise-based alternative to the XHR API for making HTTP requests. It offers a more flexible and powerful way to handle network requests and supports features like request and response objects, headers, and streaming.

- **Geolocation API**: The Geolocation API allows web applications to retrieve the geographic location of a device. It provides methods to obtain the latitude and longitude coordinates of the user's device, enabling location-based services.

- **Canvas API**: The Canvas API provides a way to programmatically draw graphics and animations on a web page using JavaScript. It offers methods for creating and manipulating shapes, paths, images, and text.

- **Web Storage API**: The Web Storage API provides a way to store and retrieve data on the client-side. It includes the `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` objects, allowing developers to store data persistently or temporarily within the browser.

These are just a few examples of the many web APIs available. Web APIs provide developers with powerful tools to create interactive web applications, access device capabilities, handle network requests, and manipulate web page content.

**Q.3 Explain `setTimeout` and `setInterval`.**

`setTimeout` and `setInterval` are JavaScript functions used to schedule the execution of code after a certain delay or at regular intervals:

- **`setTimeout`:** The `setTimeout` function is used to execute a specified function or code snippet after a specified delay (in milliseconds). It takes two arguments: a function or code snippet to execute, and the delay duration.

  Example:
  ```javascript
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Delayed message');
  }, 2000);
  ```

  In the example, the code inside the arrow function will be executed after a delay of 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds).

- **`setInterval`:** The `setInterval` function is used to repeatedly execute a specified function or code snippet at a defined interval. It takes two arguments: a function or code snippet to execute, and the interval duration.

  Example:
  ```javascript
  setInterval(() => {
    console.log('Interval message');
  }, 1000);
  ```

  In the example, the code inside the arrow function will be executed repeatedly at an interval of 1000 milliseconds (1 second).

Both `setTimeout` and `setInterval` return a unique identifier (a numeric value) that can be used to cancel the scheduled execution using the `clearTimeout` or `clearInterval` functions, respectively.

```javascript
const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Delayed message');
}, 2000);

clearTimeout(timeoutId); // Cancel the scheduled timeout

const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
  console.log('Interval message');
}, 1000);

clearInterval(intervalId); // Cancel the scheduled interval
```

The `setTimeout` and `setInterval` functions are commonly used for adding delays, performing animations, updating real-time data, or scheduling repetitive tasks in JavaScript applications.

**Q.4 How can you handle Async code in JavaScript?**

Asynchronous code in JavaScript can be handled using several techniques:

1. **Callbacks**: Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions and are invoked once the asynchronous operation is complete. They allow you to specify what to do after the operation finishes. However, callbacks can lead to callback hell and make the code harder to read and maintain.

2. **Promises**: Promises provide a more structured and readable way to handle asynchronous operations. They represent a value that may be available now, in the future, or never. Promises allow you to chain multiple asynchronous operations together, handle success and error cases separately, and use methods like `then()` and `catch()` for handling the results.

3. **Async/await**: Async/await is a more modern approach introduced in ES2017 (ES8) that allows you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous-like manner. It uses the `async` and `await` keywords. The `async` keyword is used to define an asynchronous function, and the `await` keyword is used to pause the execution of the function until a promise is resolved. This approach simplifies the code structure and improves readability.

4. **Event listeners**: Asynchronous operations in the browser environment, such as user interactions or network requests, can be handled using event listeners. Event listeners are attached to specific events (e.g., button click, data load) and execute a callback function when the event occurs.

The choice of which technique to use depends on the specific use case and the programming style preferences. Promises and async/await are generally recommended for managing asynchronous code due to their readability and better error handling capabilities.

**Q.5 What are Callbacks and Callback Hell?**

Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed when a certain operation or task is completed. They allow you to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript by specifying the behavior to be executed once the asynchronous task finishes.

Callback Hell, also known as the Pyramid of Doom, refers

 to a situation where callbacks are nested within each other, resulting in deeply nested and unreadable code. It occurs when multiple asynchronous operations depend on the results of previous operations. The code structure becomes complex, making it hard to understand and maintain.

Here's an example of callback hell:

```javascript
asyncOperation1(function (result1) {
  asyncOperation2(result1, function (result2) {
    asyncOperation3(result2, function (result3) {
      // More nested callbacks...
    });
  });
});
```

In the example, each callback depends on the result of the previous operation, leading to deeply nested callbacks. As the number of dependent operations increases, the code becomes harder to read and follow.

Callback Hell can be mitigated by using techniques such as Promises or async/await, which provide a more structured and readable way to handle asynchronous code. Promises allow you to chain multiple asynchronous operations and handle errors separately. async/await simplifies the code structure by using asynchronous code in a synchronous-like manner, eliminating the need for callbacks.

**Q.6 What are Promises & Explain Some Three Methods of Promise?**

Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. They provide a cleaner and more structured way to handle asynchronous code compared to callbacks.

A Promise can be in one of the following states:

- **Pending**: The initial state. The promise is still undergoing computation, and the final result is not available yet.
- **Fulfilled**: The promise has resolved successfully with a value. The result is available, and subsequent actions can be taken.
- **Rejected**: The promise encountered an error or was rejected with a reason. The error details are available, and appropriate error handling can be performed.

Promises have three main methods:

1. **`then()`:** The `then()` method is used to handle the successful fulfillment of a promise. It takes two optional arguments: a success callback function and a failure callback function. The success callback is invoked with the resolved value of the promise, while the failure callback is invoked if the promise is rejected.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
     // Asynchronous operation
     const result = 42;
     resolve(result);
   });

   promise.then((value) => {
     console.log(value); // 42
   }).catch((error) => {
     console.error(error);
   });
   ```

   In the example, the `then()` method is used to handle the successful resolution of the promise. The success callback is invoked with the resolved value (`42`) as an argument.

2. **`catch()`:** The `catch()` method is used to handle the rejection of a promise. It is similar to providing a failure callback function as the second argument of `then()`, but it specifically handles promise rejections.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
     // Asynchronous operation
     reject(new Error('Promise rejected'));
   });

   promise.catch((error) => {
     console.error(error); // Error: Promise rejected
   });
   ```

   In the example, the `catch()` method is used to handle the rejection of the promise. The error object (`Error: Promise rejected`) is passed to the callback function.

3. **`finally()`:** The `finally()` method is used to specify a callback that is executed regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected. It allows you to define cleanup logic or perform actions that need to be executed in both success and error cases.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
     // Asynchronous operation
     resolve('Promise fulfilled');
   });

   promise.then((value) => {
     console.log(value); // Promise fulfilled
   }).catch((error) => {
     console.error(error);
   }).finally(() => {
     console.log('Cleanup');
   });
   ```

   In the example, the `finally()` method is used to log 'Cleanup' regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

These methods provide a way to handle the various states of a Promise and specify the actions to be taken when the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

**Q.7 What's `async` and `await` keywords in JavaScript?**

The `async` and `await` keywords are part of the asynchronous programming model introduced in ES2017 (ES8). They provide a way to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous-like manner, making it easier to reason about and write asynchronous JavaScript.

- **`async`**: The `async` keyword is used to define an asynchronous function. When a function is marked as `async`, it automatically returns a Promise. The function can contain `await` expressions to pause the execution and wait for a Promise to be resolved.

  Example:
  ```javascript
  async function fetchData() {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  }
  ```

  In the example, the `fetchData` function is defined as an asynchronous function using the `async` keyword. It uses `await` to pause the execution until the `fetch` request is resolved and the JSON data is parsed.

- **`await`**: The `await` keyword can only be used inside an `async` function. It allows the function to pause and wait for a Promise to be resolved or rejected. When encountering an `await` expression, the function is blocked until the Promise is settled. The value of the `await` expression is the resolved value of the Promise.

  Example:
  ```javascript
  async function fetchData() {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  }
  ```

  In the example, the `await` keyword is used twice to pause the execution of the `fetchData` function until the promises returned by `fetch` and `response.json()` are resolved.

The combination of `async` and `await` provides a more natural way to work with Promises and write asynchronous code that resembles synchronous code. It simplifies error handling, improves readability, and reduces the complexity of callback-based or promise-chained code.

**Q.8 Explain the purpose of the `try` and `catch` block and why we need it?**

The `try` and `catch` blocks are used for error handling in JavaScript. They allow you to handle potential errors and exceptions that may occur during the execution of a block of code. The purpose of the `try` and `catch` block is to provide a mechanism for gracefully handling errors and preventing them from crashing the program.

The structure of the `try` and `catch` block is as follows:

```javascript
try {
  // Code that may throw an error
} catch (error) {
  // Error handling logic
}
```

Here's how it works:

1. The code within the `try` block is executed.
2. If an error occurs during the execution of the `try` block, the execution is immediately transferred to the corresponding `catch` block.
3. The `catch` block receives the error object as an argument. It contains information about the error, such as its type and message.
4. The code within the `catch` block handles the error. It can perform error-specific logic,

 log error messages, or take appropriate actions to recover from the error.
5. After the `catch` block is executed, the program continues to execute the remaining code after the `try...catch` statement.

The `try...catch` statement is useful for several reasons:

- **Error handling**: It allows you to catch and handle errors gracefully. Instead of crashing the program, you can provide fallback behavior, display error messages to users, or log the errors for debugging purposes.

- **Preventing program termination**: By handling errors, you prevent the program from terminating abruptly. This ensures that the program can continue executing even if an error occurs in a specific section of the code.

- **Fault tolerance**: Error handling using `try...catch` provides a level of fault tolerance. It allows the program to recover from errors and continue executing in a controlled manner.

- **Debugging**: The `catch` block allows you to log error messages or inspect the error object, aiding in the debugging process.

Overall, the `try...catch` block is essential for writing robust and error-tolerant JavaScript code, ensuring that potential errors are handled gracefully without crashing the entire program.

**Q.9 Explain `fetch`.**

`fetch` is a modern JavaScript function introduced as a replacement for the older `XMLHttpRequest` (XHR) object for making network requests (e.g., HTTP requests) in the browser. It provides a more powerful and flexible way to handle asynchronous data fetching from servers.

The `fetch` function returns a Promise that resolves to the `Response` object representing the response to the request. It can be used to retrieve various types of data, such as JSON, text, or binary data.

Here's a basic example of using `fetch` to make an HTTP GET request and retrieve JSON data:

```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

In the example, the `fetch` function is called with the URL of the API endpoint. It returns a Promise, and the `then()` method is used to handle the response. The first `then()` extracts the JSON data from the response using the `json()` method, and the second `then()` receives the parsed data. If an error occurs, the `catch()` method handles it.

`fetch` supports various options and settings to customize the request, such as headers, request methods (GET, POST, etc.), request body, and more. It also allows handling cookies, cross-origin requests, and other advanced features through additional settings.

`fetch` provides a more modern and flexible way to handle network requests compared to traditional approaches like XHR. However, it's important to handle errors appropriately using the `catch()` method to ensure proper error handling and prevent unhandled promise rejections.

**Q.10 How do you define an asynchronous function in JavaScript using async/await?**

To define an asynchronous function using async/await in JavaScript, you use the `async` keyword before the function declaration. This marks the function as asynchronous and allows you to use the `await` keyword inside the function.

Here's an example of defining an asynchronous function using async/await:

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    throw new Error('Data fetch failed');
  }
}
```

In the example, the `fetchData` function is defined as an asynchronous function using the `async` keyword. Inside the function, the `await` keyword is used to pause the execution and wait for the completion of the asynchronous `fetch` request and JSON parsing.

The function can also include error handling using a `try...catch` block. If an error occurs during the execution of the asynchronous operations, it will be caught in the `catch` block, where you can handle the error and perform appropriate actions.

Async/await allows you to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous-like manner, improving readability and reducing the complexity of nested callbacks or promise chains. It simplifies error handling by using try/catch blocks and provides a cleaner structure for asynchronous code.
